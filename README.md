S2022 CISC320 Prof. Silber Programming Project 2- Cryptograms

## Cryptograms

Cryptograms are a type of word puzzle where a string of text is encoded using a simple letter substitution cipher. Each letter is mapped to some other letter, and must be decoded through trial and error. However, because the string of text can offer further clues to narrow down possibilities: any letters surrounded by spaces must form a valid word, for instance.

## Formal Description

**Problem:** Given a cryptogram (via StdIn), print all the possible decodings (via StdOut)

## Details of output:

> Print to StdOut
> First line should be the number of decodings
> Sort the output alphabetically

### Example Input:
```
gop pgo

### Example Output:
```
